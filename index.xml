      <description>The ZedCorp challenge alias &amp;ldquo;My name is Rookie&amp;rdquo; was a realistic challenge proposed at Hacklab ESGI CTF 2019. ZedCorp is a small startup who work in computer science and particulary in development. The goal was to recover confidential files owned by the CEO.
For this recap, I want to do some analyses on my challenge to know how challengers proceed to solve it. There is some fun facts :D You can read writeups here to understand the context :</description>

For this challenge, I wanted to teach challengers the principle of SSH tunneling and basics of penetration testing.

      <description>I think you know what I am talking about. The &amp;ldquo;file upload&amp;rdquo; vulnerability is familiar for you ? Nice. So you know how it could be difficult to bypass protection to upload a webshell. I will show you a little technique to add to your test when you are trying to exploit file upload :)
This technique is inspired from the challenge l33t-hoster of the Insomni&#39;hack Teaser 2019 CTF
So follow the guide !</description>

      <description>Netrunner is the second biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus 2018 CTF. The challenge is not really hard, but could be particulary annoying if you don&#39;t know what to do. You need to have some skills in pentest web and medium skills in Linux system.
The challenge is divided in 3 steps. Each step has its own validation password (flag). So let&#39;s begin with the first step !
1st step - You have a mission !</description>

      <description>ArchDrive is the biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus 2018 CTF and my favorite one. It&#39;s divided in 5 steps of increasing difficulty. The challenge is not really hard, but particularly long and time-consuming. You need to have some strong skills in web pentesting, some basic skills in forensic and medium skills in Linux system.
So, as you can see, the 5 steps have their own validation password (flag). Let&#39;s start the challenge !</description>
