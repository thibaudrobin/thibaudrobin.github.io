      <description>I think you know what I am talking about. The &amp;ldquo;file upload&amp;rdquo; vulnerability is familiar for you ? Nice. So you know how it could be difficult to bypass protection to upload a webshell. I will show you a little technique to add to your test when you are trying to exploit file upload :)
This technique is inspired from the challenge l33t-hoster of the Insomni&amp;rsquo;hack Teaser 2019 CTF</description>

      <description>Netrunner is the second biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus CTF. The challenge is not really hard, but could be particulary annoying if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. You need to have some skills in pentest web and medium skills in Linux system.
The challenge is divided in 3 steps. Each step has its own validation password (flag). So let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the first step !
1st step - You have a mission !</description>

      <description>ArchDrive is the biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus CTF and my favorite one. It&amp;rsquo;s divided in 5 steps of increasing difficulty. The challenge is not really hard, but particularly long and time-consuming. You need to have some strong skills in web pentesting, some basic skills in forensic and medium skills in Linux system.
So, as you can see, the 5 steps have their own validation password (flag). Let&amp;rsquo;s start the challenge !</description>
