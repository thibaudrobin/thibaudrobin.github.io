      <description>Hacklab ESGI CTF 2019 is a &amp;ldquo;Capture The Flag&amp;rdquo; competition in a Jeopardy style. It&amp;rsquo;s organize by security enthusiasts, members of Hacklab ESGI security association. For the 2019 edition, I wanted to share some knowledges to challengers. So I decided to join the CTF Staff and create a big web/system challenge : ZedCorp alias &amp;lsquo;My name is Rookie&amp;rsquo;.
Participate to a CTF like Staff is quite different than participate like player.</description>

      <description>Netrunner is the second biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus 2018 CTF. The challenge is not really hard, but could be particulary annoying if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. You need to have some skills in pentest web and medium skills in Linux system.
The challenge is divided in 3 steps. Each step has its own validation password (flag). So let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the first step !

      <description>ArchDrive is the biggest challenge of the Santhacklaus 2018 CTF and my favorite one. It&amp;rsquo;s divided in 5 steps of increasing difficulty. The challenge is not really hard, but particularly long and time-consuming. You need to have some strong skills in web pentesting, some basic skills in forensic and medium skills in Linux system.
So, as you can see, the 5 steps have their own validation password (flag). Let&amp;rsquo;s start the challenge !</description>
