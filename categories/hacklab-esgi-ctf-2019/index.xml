      <description>Hacklab ESGI CTF 2019 is a &amp;ldquo;Capture The Flag&amp;rdquo; competition in a Jeopardy style. It&amp;rsquo;s organize by security enthusiasts, members of Hacklab ESGI security association. For the 2019 edition, I wanted to share some knowledges to challengers. So I decided to join the CTF Staff and create a big web/system challenge : ZedCorp alias &amp;lsquo;My name is Rookie&amp;rsquo;.
Participate to a CTF like Staff is quite different than participate like player.</description>

For this challenge, I wanted to teach challengers the principle of SSH tunneling and basics of penetration testing.
