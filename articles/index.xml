      <description>I think you know what I am talking about. The &amp;ldquo;file upload&amp;rdquo; vulnerability is familiar for you ? Nice. So you know how it could be difficult to bypass protection to upload a webshell. I will show you a little technique to add to your test when you are trying to exploit file upload :)
This technique is inspired from the challenge l33t-hoster of the Insomni&amp;rsquo;hack Teaser 2019 CTF</description>
